1. The idea for making this project comes from here:
<br>
We had found that there is exceptionally no such web application where students can read pdf notes from college students / friends as well as ask their doubts on a specific topics.


2.  We had started  creating the application with simple HTML and CSS code.

3. So we are in the way of upgrading more features and make our application as best as possible 
4. We had used **firebase realtime database** for upgrating doubts and comments on a specific topic 

5. The user can edit or delete his/her comment and would have healty discussion on the specific topic 
6. For pdf viewing in browser we have simply used the **iframe** and thus we were good to go.
7. Some features were still in upgradation  mode since we were running out of time but we promise to complete this application even our deadline 


Thats how!  we had created the application  and participated in our first Hackathon!
